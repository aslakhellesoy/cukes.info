This is the new website for cukes.info. It uses Jekyll.

h2. Building
* Install mojombo-jekyll
* Install pygments
* Install http://github.com/bmabey/cucumber-pygments-lexer/tree/master
* Install the latest cucumber gem
* Regenerate _includes/i18n_examples.html:
** rake i18n_examples
** This is optional - the generated file is in Git
** Only do this if one of the following:
*** The Gherkin pygments lexer is updated (It still doesn't recognise several of the i18n keywords for some reason)
*** _includes/i18n_examples.erb has been edited
* jekyll --server --auto
